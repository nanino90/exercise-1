# ASSUMPTIONS #

-EEPROM sends with the data a data integrity system detectable by the CPU (e.g. CRC or parity bit).
-Since the API does not include the address to call the EEPROM, I created a new function with it.
-The controller_context allows access to the system variables from diferent interrupts and functions, so keep an eye on multiple access.
-The overflow of the int32 for the timer does not affect the periodicity of the debug LEDs.
